Since moving to California for graduate school and work, I’ve been starting to experiment more with urban landscape and street photography. It’s easy to find what you’re looking for: nature trails, national parks, large metropolitan cities. California has it all. From the picturesque homes of San Francisco to the seaside views of San Diego, it’s been exciting to explore the state during my time living in San Diego and the Bay Area. 

This album features scenes from around California.
