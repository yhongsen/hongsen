China's transformation since the early 2000s has been incredible. What used to be an arduous multi-day journey to my parents' hometowns and smog so thick you can't see 10 feet in front is now a few-hour high-speed train ride away, with clear blue skies.

Similarly, I've grown to embrace my heritage and appreciate the numerous family trips I took during my childhood. I used to count the days until I returned to the US, but now I genuinely enjoy exploring the local areas I visit.

This album features selected photos from my trips to China.
