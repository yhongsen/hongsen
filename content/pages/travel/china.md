China's transformation since the early 2000's has been incredible. What used to be an arduous multi-day journey to my parents' hometowns and smog so thick you can't see 10 feet in front is now a few hour highspeed train ride away and clear blue skies.

Similarly, Iâ€™ve grown to embrace my heritage and appreciate the numerous family trips in my childhood. I used to just count the days until I returned back to the US, but now I genuinely enjoy exploring the local areas I visit.

This album features selected photos from my trips to China.
