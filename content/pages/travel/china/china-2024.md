It’s been 8 years since my last trip to China but I’m grateful for the opportunity to see my maternal grandma one last time in good health, reconnect with relatives, and to to capture memories of my mom's hometown.

Over this two week family trip, we visited Chengdu, Emei Mountain, Hunan Province, Zhouzhuang, and Shanghai.
