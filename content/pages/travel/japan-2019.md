My second trip to Japan in the spring of 2019 starting in Fukuoka, traveling south to Kagoshima and Yakushima, then north to Kyoto and Tokyo. From exploring the island and moss-covered forests of Yakushima to train watching in Kagoshima and Tokyo, I'm always left with the desire to return to continue exploring more of Japan.
