Every time I visit Japan, I find myself drawn to the public transportation infrastructure and the distinct blend of modern and traditional architecture. Japan's trains catch my eye in particular. The futuristic Shinkansen and traditional local trains are visually striking in contrast to their countryside and cityscape environments, which make them a joy to photograph.

Along with picturesque temples, distinct seasons, and dynamic regional climates, Japan has so much to explore. This album features selected photos from my trips to Japan.
