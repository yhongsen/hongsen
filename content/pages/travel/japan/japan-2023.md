My third trip to Japan was in the spring of 2023. We visited Tokyo, Mount Fuji, Matsumoto, Lake Suwa, Onomichi, and Osaka, as well as hiked a section of the Nakasendo, biked across the Shimanami Kaido, and road tripped across Shikoku.

Despite the rain and hail, biking across the Shimanami Kaido was by far my favorite experience traveling across Japan. I highly recommend it to anyone who has the chance to make the journey.
