Even though the fast paced city life is not for me, I still enjoy visiting New York City from time to time to catch up with friends and family, and of course snap photos while I wander through the busy streets. It’s always fun to search for new perspectives of Manhattan’s iconic buildings throughout the city.

This collection features photos from Manhattan, Long Island City, and Brooklyn.
